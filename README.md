## F Me On GitHub CSS Ribbon

This is a recreation of the [Fork me on GitHub ribbon](https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons)
in CSS, hence resolution-independent.

[Demo](http://zacanger.github.io/f-me-on-github/).

This is blatantly ripped off from <http://simonwhitaker.github.io/github-fork-ribbon-css/>

Installation:

`npm i -S f-me-on-github`

Note: I'm no longer going to be publishing to Bower.
[Bower is bad.](https://gofore.com/stop-using-bower/).

Link to the thing (`gh-fork-ribbon.css`).

Example:
```html
<div class="gh-fork-ribbon-wrapper left-bottom">
  <div class="gh-fork-ribbon">
    <a href="something">Fuck me on GitHub</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

See `index.html` for more examples.

Note: this project is not sponsored or in any way endorsed by GitHub, or approved of, or liked, or openly tolerated, probably.
